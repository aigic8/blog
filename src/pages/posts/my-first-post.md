Well, everybody has to start from somewhere, and this is my first step into blogging. I have to make this blog beautiful, though I am not good at UI design, I JUST HAVE TO!

So I have to check different stylings like **bold**, *italic* and `code` and check if they are well structured or not. Also I have to check multiline codes like the following one:

```go
package main
import fmt

func main() {
   fmt.Println("Hello Blog!") 
}
```

I also would like having Note callouts on my blog. Let's check the styling of that:

> [!NOTE]
> This is an important note and hopefully it renders correctly in the webpage, IF NOT BLAME THE DEVELOPER!

Oh, headings, I almost forgot about them.

# Heading 1

This is a heading 1

## Heading 2

This is a heading 2

## Heading 3

Well what can I say? You already know what it is.

## Heading 4

Anddddd so on...

I honestly don't understand why anybody would come all the way down here, to read all of this. **THIS IS NOT INSTAGRAM, STOP DOOM SCROLLING!** this is a tired dev taking too long to build a simple blog! 

I also have to check the styling of images, but I am too tired for that. I'll do it later.
